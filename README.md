Blood-Transfusion-Analysis

In this project, I use hypothesis testing to help drive informed decisions at a company inspecting blood transfusion data.

Project uses combined knowledge of R and hypothesis testing to implement an analysis. The project will require implementation of standard deviation, one and two sample t-tests, as well as an understanding of the significance on the resulting p-value to give a recommendation on the results of the study.

Recommendations and conclusions are commented as notes within code
